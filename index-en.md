### What is Cloud4est?

Cloud4est is a self-developer community whose members deepen their knowledge in the world of 21st century IT and communication systems, by learning on their own and at the same time sharing this knowledge with the community, in order to improve the whole team. These days in the labor market it's a common requirement for the youth to have extensive experience in a field of IT, and also to be able to use that knowledge when it comes to a complex development project. Cloud4est has been created with the goal of allowing anyone to acquire these skills more efficiently, without needing to participate in any kind of training program of the conventional meaning.
